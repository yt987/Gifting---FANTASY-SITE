  <h1>Following the Master</h1>
  <p>You decide to follow your master’s rules and hesitantly leave the library. Days pass, and you ask your master for stronger spells so that you can at least alleviate your brother’s pain. He tells you that you have already learned all of these, and you sigh, putting your head down in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Then, your master continues, saying, “You’ve already learned all of the legal spells, that is.”</p>

  <p>You can’t believe that he would sacrifice his own standing for your sake, and you are grateful as he teaches you a powerful pain-killing spell in only two days. While it won’t save your brother, you are happy that he gets to spend his last days not suffering.</p>

  <p>Months later, you miss your brother terribly, but you have finally reached your goal of becoming an expert in magic. However, one day, while working late in your new research laboratory, you collapse.</p>

  <p>The doctors tell you that you have the same illness that killed your brother, but that makes no sense. People are born with this illness.</p>

  <p>Only a few days pass, and you are lying on your deathbed. You had been pondering how this could have happened, and as your vision starts to fade, you realize that the illegal spell had been illegal for a reason.</p>

  <h1 class="bad-ending">BAD ENDING: YOU HAVE DIED!</h1>
