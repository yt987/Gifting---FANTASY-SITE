  <h1>Letting the Dragon Live</h1>

  <p>Exhausted, you finally step out of the darkness of the forest and squint at the bright sun overhead. You don’t even know how long it has been since you first left home, and your heart is heavy as you remember that you don’t even have the venom that inspired this journey in the first place.</p>

  <p>You don’t make it home before you are overwhelmed by a massive crowd. Judging by the angry shouts and the empty bottles flying through the air, it is most likely a riot.</p>

  <p>“FAREWELL FARENTALL FRAUDS! FAREWELL FARENTALL FRAUDS!”</p>

  <p>You gasp as you recognize your family name. How could this be happening? The Farentall family—once the most beloved outside of the royals—now being shamed by the very people who once revered them?</p>

  <p>You don’t have to be confused for long. As you stand frozen, you overhear two elderly women whispering to each other.</p>

  <p>“Unbelievable, isn’t it? To think that the strongest, bravest, and most honest family has been lying to us this entire time.”</p>

  <p>“Indeed! Do you think the King even knows that the Farentall power is stolen? And from those unsightly beasts, no less?”</p>

  <p>Your blood runs cold.</p>

  <p>Pushing through the crowd, you sneak into your home through the back entrance. You find your mother sitting at the table, wiping away her tears. At the sight of you, she rushes forward, wrapping you in a tight embrace.</p>

  <p>“You’re back! And you’re safe! Ah, I’m so relieved.”</p>

  <p>“Mother! What has happened?”</p>

  <p>A deep voice speaks from behind you. Your father.</p>

  <p>“We’ve been found out.” His voice is low, weary. “Somehow, everyone in Spesarus now knows the truth about the dragon’s venom and the Farentall power.” His gaze sharpens. “You… you haven’t told anyone, have you?”</p>

  <p>You shake your head, horrified that he would even doubt you.</p>

  <p>But then, you remember the vial that had gone missing.</p>

  <p>Had someone been following you? Had they stolen the vial? Had they recognized you and realized the truth?</p>
