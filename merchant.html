  <h1>You Have Chosen the Path of the Merchant!</h1>
  <p>You are a traveling merchant from a distant land. While this is your first time visiting Spesarus, known to be the most dangerous of the eight nations, you shake your anxieties aside because you are here on a mission.</p>

  <p>You have received intel from some shady contacts within the International Merchant’s Guild that the King’s youngest daughter, known as the “Black Jewel” and the “Rebellious Princess” to those from the other nations, is more than willing to illegally purchase silver weapons from non-registered sellers—for a hefty price. Honestly, you don’t care what the Princess is actually doing with these weapons; you just want the good pay.</p>

  <p>Your informant has set up a late-night meeting for you and the Princess in the outskirts of the Dark Forests. As you approach the meeting spot, your nervousness returns at the terrifying view ahead.</p>

  <p>Do you abandon the meeting, worried for your own safety and well-being, and head toward the safety of the village plaza? Or do you stay despite your worries, hoping for future wealth?</p>
