  <h1>The Coward’s Fate</h1>

  <p>Every instinct in your body is screaming at you to run.</p>

  <p>You turn and bolt, your boots kicking up dirt as you flee toward the village plaza.</p>

  <p>The sound of your own breath drowns out everything else. Your heartbeat pounds in your ears. The damp night air clings to your skin as you push forward, refusing to look back.</p>

  <p>Then, somewhere behind you—</p>

  <p>A low growl.</p>

  <p>Your breath catches, but you don’t stop. You push yourself harder, sprinting down the winding forest path. The lights of the village must be close now. They have to be.</p>

  <p>Then—a shadow moves in front of you.</p>

  <p>You skid to a stop, nearly losing your footing.</p>

  <p>For a moment, the forest is deathly silent.</p>

  <p>Then, glowing eyes appear in the darkness.</p>

  <p>From the shadows, a beast emerges—its fur black as the void, its limbs too long, its mouth lined with rows of jagged teeth. It lowers its body, muscles tensing, preparing to lunge.</p>

  <p>You take a step back—then it strikes.</p>

  <p>There is no time to scream.</p>
