  <h1>Taking the Gold</h1>

  <p>You hesitate for only a moment before reaching for the gold. The coins are heavy in your hands, more wealth than you’ve ever held before. Whatever the princess plans to do with the weapon is no longer your concern.</p>

  <p>Without another word, you sling the now-empty sheath over your back and turn away. The princess does not stop you, nor does she say anything as you disappear into the night.</p>

  <p>The weeks that follow are filled with luxury.</p>

  <p>With your newfound wealth, you no longer need to wander from town to town, barely scraping by. You buy yourself a comfortable home in a city far from Spesarus, where no one questions your sudden fortune. For the first time in your life, you have security. Real, tangible security.</p>

  <p>You no longer have to bargain, no longer have to haggle with cutthroat traders or risk your life on dangerous deals. You live in ease, drinking fine wine and wearing clothes of silk. If this is the cost of looking the other way, then you have no regrets.</p>

  <p>Until the news arrives.</p>

  <p>It comes first as a whisper in the marketplace.</p>

  <p>"The Rebellious Princess is dead."</p>

  <p>You nearly drop the fruit you were holding. The merchant beside you continues talking, oblivious to the shock on your face.</p>

  <p>"They say she went alone into the Dark Forest, armed with a single silver sword." The man scoffs. "Arrogant girl. She thought she could face a dragon alone?"</p>

  <p>The words send a chill through you.</p>

  <p>The weapon you sold her… the silver sword she carried…</p>

  <p>"Did she get the venom?" you ask before you can stop yourself.</p>

  <p>The merchant snorts. "Oh, she got something, alright. Burned beyond recognition, they say. By the time anyone found her, it was too late. Even the Farentall knights couldn’t save her."</p>

  <p>You exhale slowly, trying to quiet the sinking feeling in your chest.</p>

  <p>It’s not your fault, you tell yourself. She made her choice. You made yours.</p>

  <p>And yet, the unease remains.</p>

  <p>More news follows.</p>

  <p>The Farentall family—once the most powerful knights in Spesarus—has been imprisoned.</p>

  <p>The rumors say they were exposed. That the source of their strength had been revealed for all to see. That the king himself turned against them when they failed to save his youngest daughter.</p>

  <p>And just like that, an ancient legacy crumbles.</p>

  <p>The streets are filled with talk of treason, of shame, of the fall of the great Farentall name. You listen in silence, sipping fine wine in the comfort of your new home, yet something in your stomach twists.</p>

  <p>Had the princess succeeded, would things have been different? Had you refused to make the trade, would she still be alive?</p>

  <p>You shake the thoughts away. The past is the past. And you are still here. Still alive. Still rich.</p>

  <p>But for the first time, the gold in your hands feels just a little heavier.</p>
