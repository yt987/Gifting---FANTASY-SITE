  <h1>Harvesting the Venom</h1>
  <p>The creature roars as you raise your sword and fulfill your father’s wish. You watch as it lays weakly in its cave, sure that it will perish and its species will be no more. However, you turn your back and remind yourself that it was a necessary sacrifice to keep your family’s legacy.</p>

  <p>Later that night, as you venture back through the Dark Forest, set up camp, and prepare for slumber, you don’t notice a shadowy figure approach. The next morning, you tear apart your whole camp, but you can’t find the vial containing the venom.</p>

  <p>You don’t want to return home empty-handed and consider returning to the dragon to attempt taking its last drops of venom, even though it will surely die if you do. The dragon seemed special to you, and you felt almost ridiculous for thinking it could have a good friend had you not taken its venom.</p>

  <p>Do you sacrifice your family’s legacy and gift the dragon a few more days of life, or return and ensure this journey was not for nothing?</p>
