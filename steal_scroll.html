  <h1>Stealing the Scroll</h1>
  <p>You stuff the scroll in your satchel and dash out through the library’s side door. You keep running until you’ve returned to your family’s cottage, but then stop. You start to wonder if you are even skilled enough to perform the forbidden spell at this point in your training.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you could hire someone from the Mages Guild to help you? It would be risky—if the mage you ask is loyal to the Spesarus lawmakers, you could be turned in and punished. But performing a spell of this difficulty might do more harm than good if done incorrectly.</p>

  <p>Hopefully, with your current knowledge, you can make do and save your brother before his time runs out.</p>
