  <h1>Defying the Princess</h1>

  <p>Before you realize it, you have dashed between them, raising your sword against the Princess. You will surely be executed for this treason if she reports you to the Council. The dragon shakes its head and lays down again.</p>

  <p>The Princess raises an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>“I-I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but I can’t let you kill her.” You attempt to stand tall with confidence, but fail miserably, your arms visibly shaking.</p>

  <p>“Her? Wait, don’t tell me… you weren’t tasked with slaying this dragon? Are you here to protect it? Or… have you abandoned your mission to slay it?” She steps closer, eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>Your silence speaks volumes.</p>

  <p>The Princess nods in understanding. “Sorry, knight, but I can’t afford to abandon my mission.”</p>

  <p>She shoves you aside with unexpected strength. You stumble, your sword slipping from your grasp. The manic expression returns to her face as she raises her blade once more.</p>

  <p>At the last second, you dive between the silver and the scales, hoping your sacrifice will save the beautiful creature.</p>
