  <h1>Refusing the Trade</h1>

  <p>Your grip tightens around the sword's sheath, but your gut is screaming at you to stop. Something about this deal is wrong.</p>

  <p>"No," you say.</p>

  <p>The Princess narrows her eyes. "Excuse me?"</p>

  <p>"I’m not selling it to you," you say firmly. "If you go after the dragon, you’ll die. And I don't do business with dead clients."</p>

  <p>Silence. The air feels heavier, as if even the trees are holding their breath.</p>

  <p>Her expression darkens. "You realize you’re turning down more gold than you’ll ever see again, right?"</p>

  <p>You force yourself to hold her gaze. "I'd rather keep my life than sell you your death."</p>

  <p>For a moment, you think she might pull the dagger from her hip and end this argument another way. But then, unexpectedly, she exhales sharply and chuckles.</p>

  <p>"Fine," she mutters, stepping away. "Keep your damn sword."</p>

  <p>Relieved, you start to leave, but something about her demeanor catches your attention. She isn’t packing up her camp.</p>

  <p>"You're not leaving?" you ask.</p>

  <p>She shakes her head. "No need."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>She smirks. "I’ve been following a Farentall knight into the Dark Forests for days. I know they’re trying to get the venom right now. Why should I risk my life when I can just steal it from them?"</p>

  <p>Your stomach twists. You wonder briefly if you should warn the knight—whoever they are—but you know better than to get involved in something that isn't your fight. Without another word, you turn and disappear into the darkness, leaving the princess to her plans.</p>

  <p>Weeks pass.</p>

  <p>Gold remains scarce. You take odd jobs, shady trades, anything to scrape by. You tell yourself refusing the princess was the right choice, even as hunger gnaws at your ribs.</p>

  <p>Then, the rumors start.</p>

  <p>At first, you dismiss them as fantasy. Stories of a rebellion finally succeeding, of King Speran executed, of Spesarus under new rule. But when the whispers turn to celebrations, you begin to wonder.</p>

  <p>Then, one night, you hear the words that make your blood run cold.</p>

  <p>"That Rebellious Princess now sits on the throne! She somehow obtained great power, and defeated her father!" someone murmurs at a market stall.</p>

  <p>You freeze. She actually did it. Days pass before you finally give in to your curiosity. You return to Spesarus.</p>

  <p>It's a different city than the one you left. The tension that once strangled its streets is gone, replaced by laughter and music. Soldiers no longer glare at passersby. Merchants sell their goods without the fear of royal taxes crushing them. The kingdom you once feared stepping foot in is now... thriving.</p>

  <p>You find yourself at a tavern, ordering a drink, when a familiar voice speaks from behind you.</p>

  <p>"So," the voice says. "You survived after all."</p>

  <p>You turn, and there she is. No longer the Rebellious Princess, but Queen of Spesarus.</p>

  <p>Her presence dominates the room, though she wears no crown. Her cloak is still the same, but her eyes are sharper, her smirk filled with something new—satisfaction, power.</p>

  <p>"Didn’t expect to see you here," she says, leaning on the counter beside you.</p>

  <p>You shrug. "Didn’t expect to see you alive."</p>

  <p>She laughs. "Neither did I." Then she glances at you, eyes thoughtful. "You know, I figured something out after the dust settled."</p>

  <p>You raise an eyebrow. "Oh?"</p>

  <p>"If you had sold me that sword, I would have died. Simple as that." She tilts her head. "And since I’m not too keen on owing debts, I figure I should return the favor."</p>

  <p>You blink. "Return the favor?"</p>

  <p>She leans in slightly, voice smooth. "How does a wealthy position under the Queen's favor sound?"</p>

  <p>For a moment, you are speechless. A lifetime of running from city to city, surviving by the edge of your wits... and now the most powerful person in the kingdom is offering you security, power, wealth—all because you refused to make a single trade.</p>

  <p>You look at her, the woman who now controls Spesarus, and realize...</p>

  <p>You made the best deal of your life.</p>
