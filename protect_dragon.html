  <h1>Protecting the Dragon</h1>
  
  <p>You resheath your sword and watch as the dragon blinks at you with its golden eyes. You never had the courage to tell anyone—too burdened by the future of knighthood looming over you—but since childhood, you had been fascinated by the creatures of the Dark Forests, spending long nights in your living quarters reading ancient books filled with tales of these legendary beasts.</p>

  <p>The dragon before you is beautiful, and judging by its lack of hesitation as it leans forward when you raise your hand, it seems to like you too. You can’t believe anyone would destroy such a majestic being for the sake of war. You don’t know what to do. You don’t want to return home empty-handed, but you refuse to harm the dragon.</p>

  <p>Lost in thought, you remain in the cave for several days, carefully observing the creature and writing down everything you can about its appearance and behavior in your journal. On the evening of the fourth day, you hear noises outside the cave.</p>

  <p>From the shadows, you watch as a figure approaches, a silver sword raised high—the kind given only to your family, known to be the only blade capable of piercing a dragon’s scales.</p>

  <p>“Who are you?” you shout, lifting your own sword. Your jaw drops as the figure pulls back their hood, revealing the youngest princess of Spesarus, who repeats your question, shocked that another person has dared to brave the Dark Forests. “Who are you?”</p>

  <p>You immediately kneel, lowering your weapon. “Princess! I am deeply sorry. I am a knight from the Farentall family, sent on a journey at my father’s request.”</p>

  <p>Silence fills the air as you keep your gaze fixed on the ground, sweating as you wait for a response. Then, you hear a loud laugh.</p>

  <p>When you look up, the princess is grinning widely. “Well, hello there, brave knight! Have you also come to slay this great dragon? Unfortunately for you, I must take care of it myself, so you’ll have to find another way to earn your honor!”</p>

  <p>You’re momentarily stunned by her casual speech—so direct and friendly, completely unlike the elder daughters of the royal family whom you had seen at coronation ceremonies. You had heard rumors from the village folk that this princess was rude and unrefined, but the woman before you doesn’t match that image at all.</p>

  <p>However, as her words sink in, your heart drops. She wants to kill the dragon?</p>

  <p>A million questions fly through your mind. How did she survive the journey here? How did she obtain a silver sword? Why does she want to kill the dragon? How does she even know of its existence?</p>

  <p>Lost in thought, you fail to notice the princess stepping toward the dragon. The beast rises abruptly, a growl rumbling from its throat. The princess raises her sword, her expression shifting into something wild—excited, almost manic.</p>

  <p>Do you follow your instincts and intervene, risking unlawful action against a royal, or do you stand by helplessly as the princess and the dragon begin their battle?</p>
