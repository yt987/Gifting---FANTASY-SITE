  <h1>The Merchant’s Gamble</h1>

  <p>You take a deep breath and tighten your grip on the sword’s sheath. The weapon rests against your back, hidden beneath your cloak, but you can still feel the weight of it. A single silver blade, worth more than a year’s worth of trades. The kind of sale that could set you up for life.</p>

  <p>When the Rebellious Princess finally emerges from the shadows, she moves with a quiet confidence, her cloak billowing slightly in the cold night air. She stops a few paces away, sharp eyes scanning you in the dim moonlight.</p>

  <p>"You're the seller?" she asks.</p>

  <p>"That depends," you say. "Are you the buyer?"</p>

  <p>She smirks. "I like you already." She gestures for you to follow.</p>

  <p>You hesitate. Normally, trades happen quickly—quiet, simple, no unnecessary movement. This is different. A princess meeting alone, out here, with no guards? The weight of the sword against your back suddenly feels heavier.</p>

  <p>Still, you need this deal. You follow.</p>

  <p>The two of you stop at a small clearing, where a wooden chest rests beside a crackling fire. She kneels and lifts the lid, revealing gold coins glinting in the firelight.</p>

  <p>"Your payment," she says. "Now, where is the weapon?"</p>

  <p>You pull the sheath from your back and hold it out, but something about the situation gnaws at you. The unease lingers.</p>

  <p>"What exactly are you planning to do with this?" you ask.</p>

  <p>She exhales sharply. "That’s none of your concern."</p>

  <p>You don’t move. "Maybe not. But if I’m risking my neck for this deal, I deserve to know what I’m getting involved in."</p>

  <p>She watches you for a long moment before finally speaking. "Sperasus is rotting," she says. "And my father is the disease."</p>

  <p>Your fingers tighten around the sheath. "You plan to rebel?"</p>

  <p>She smiles, but there’s no humor in it. "Not plan. I will."</p>

  <p>The realization hits hard. You aren’t just selling a weapon—you are arming a rebellion. And before you can fully process it, she adds, "But I need more than just steel. I need the venom."</p>

  <p>You frown. "Venom?"</p>

  <p>"The blood of a dying kingdom cannot be cured with mere swords," she says. "The knights of Farentall have held their power for centuries. Do you know why?"</p>

  <p>You shake your head.</p>

  <p>Her expression darkens. "The venom of the last dragon. A single drop grants strength beyond any mortal. But no ordinary blade can pierce its scales." She gestures toward the silver weapon in your hands. "That’s where this comes in."</p>

  <p>You stare at her, trying to process the weight of what she is saying. You had heard stories of knights too powerful to be human, of wars that should have been lost but weren’t. But dragons? Venom? The existence of such things was beyond anything you had ever believed real.</p>

  <p>"And you think you can… take it?" you ask.</p>

  <p>She tilts her head slightly. "I don’t think. I know."</p>

  <p>The fire crackles between you. If she is telling the truth, then this blade will not just help her overthrow a king—it will help her become something unstoppable. You have no loyalty to the kingdom, nor to the princess. You only wanted coin. But now, you realize the choice before you is far greater than just a sale.</p>

  <p>Do you hand over the sword and accept the gold, securing a fortune while unknowingly shaping the fate of Spesarus?</p>

  <p>Or do you refuse, knowing that walking away could make you an enemy of the most dangerous woman in the kingdom?</p>
