  <h1>The Final Mistake</h1>
  <p>You return to the dragon’s cave with a grim expression. It sleeps with its eyes closed, and using your sword, you cut its lips and attempt to retrieve the last drops of venom from its jaw.</p>

  <p>It awakens suddenly, and recognizing you, starts roaring frighteningly. You attempt to dash out, but it spits out a green flame that strikes you on your back.</p>

  <p>Weakened, you crawl out of the cave and roll into the river that runs nearby, panting. After a few moments, you open your eyes, looking up, and see the inside of the dragon’s mouth—until the blood from its lip blinds you.</p>

  <h1 class="bad-ending">BAD ENDING: YOU HAVE DIED!</h1>
