  <h1>Seeking the Mage’s Help</h1>

  <p>The Mages Guild is eerily quiet at this hour, its halls dimly lit by flickering lanterns. You tread carefully, unsure of where to begin, when a shadow moves near the far end of the corridor.</p>

  <p>A hooded figure—no older than you—slips into a narrow passageway, her steps quick and deliberate. You hesitate only a moment before following.</p>

  <p>Through the passage, you find a hidden study, overflowing with scrolls, arcane symbols scrawled across the walls. The girl glances up, unimpressed by your presence.</p>

  <p>“You’re either lost or stupid,” she mutters, flipping through a worn tome.</p>

  <p>“I need help,” you say quickly. “A spell—an important one.”</p>

  <p>She raises an eyebrow. “And why should I care?”</p>

  <p>Swallowing your pride, you explain everything—the scroll, your brother, your failures. Something in your voice must convince her, because she sighs and gestures for you to sit.</p>

  <p>“Fine. Let’s see what you’ve got.”</p>

  <p>Hours pass as the two of you pour over the incantation, arguing over its meaning, testing minor spells for clues. She’s sharp—sharper than anyone you’ve ever met—but even she struggles with the cryptic language.</p>

  <p>Then, late into the night, her eyes widen. “Wait,” she whispers. “This part here—it's not about preserving life. It’s about adding to it.”</p>

  <p>You lean closer. “What do you mean?”</p>

  <p>She hesitates. “This isn’t about healing. It’s about… transferring.”</p>

  <p>A cold dread creeps into your chest. “Transferring what?”</p>

  <p>She meets your gaze. “A lifespan. Someone has to lose theirs… for yours to grow.”</p>

  <p>The words sink in slowly. You push back from the table, shaking your head. “No. That can’t be right.”</p>

  <p>“It is.” Her voice is grim. “And it means the spell works.”</p>

  <p>You don’t know how long you sit there, staring at the cursed scroll. The key to immortality has been in your hands all along. But it demands a cost.</p>

  <p>One life for another.</p>

  <p>“I can’t do this,” you say. “There has to be another way.”</p>

  <p>She shrugs. “Then I guess your brother dies.”</p>

  <p>Your breath catches. You clench your fists. “That’s not fair.”</p>

  <p>“Life isn’t.” She leans back, watching you. “You came to me because you were desperate. And I just gave you an answer.”</p>

  <p>You close your eyes. You only have a few hours left.</p>

  <p>The silence stretches. Then, the girl exhales. “Look, if you won’t do it…” She stands, stepping toward you. “Then I will.”</p>

  <p>You barely register her words before a wave of force slams into you, knocking you against the wall.</p>

  <p>You gasp for air, dazed. She looms over you, the scroll clutched in her hands, her voice barely above a whisper. “I could use a little extra time myself.”</p>

  <p>You try to move, but it's too late. The spell is already being cast.</p>

  <p>Your vision fades. Your strength drains. You can feel it—the years being ripped from your body.</p>

  <p>In your last moments, you see her smiling.</p>
