  <h1>You Have Chosen the Path of the Mage!</h1>
  <p>Your younger brother is terribly ill, doomed to have an early and painful death, so you become an apprentice of an infamous albeit mysterious expert of magic. After years of rigorous study and training, you discover a forbidden scroll hidden underground in his library that you recognize to hold the secrets behind immortality. It is against your master’s rules, and you will surely be sent to the kingdom’s dungeons if you take it. Also, your master has promised that only a few months of study remain before you can become a dignified expert of magic. However, your brother’s condition is at its worst, and his doctor had said that he will surely perish in a matter of weeks. You know if you get caught stealing the scroll you will be imprisoned—or even worse—and if you take the forbidden scroll you might not even have the skills or knowledge to perform the advanced magic.</p>

  <p>Quick! You hear footsteps approaching the library. What will you choose?</p>

  <div class="choice-buttons">
      <button onclick="location.href='follow_master.html'">Follow your master’s rules and ignore the scroll, hoping that your brother can last longer until you finish your training with your temporary healing spells.</button>
      <button onclick="location.href='steal_scroll.html'">Snatch the forbidden scroll and hide. You must take any chance to save your brother, regardless of any supposed punishments or risks.</button>
