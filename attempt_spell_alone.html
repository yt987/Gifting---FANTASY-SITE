    <h1>Attempting the Spell Alone</h1>

    <p>The spell refuses to work. You’ve spent weeks trying to decipher it, repeating incantations over and over, tracing every symbol in the scroll until your fingers ache. But no matter how hard you try, you can’t unlock its power.</p>
  
    <p>And now, you’re out of time.</p>
  
    <p>Earlier today, the doctor gave you the news you had been dreading—your brother will not live to see morning. His body is too weak. His breathing too shallow. Before midnight, he will be gone.</p>
  
    <p>Frantic, you rush to your master’s library, determined to find the missing key before it’s too late. Candlelight flickers as you flip through the scroll, desperately searching for meaning in its vague words. The symbols blur together, frustration clouding your thoughts. Then a voice breaks the silence.</p>
  
    <p>“You're thinking too hard.”</p>
  
    <p>You nearly drop the scroll. Whipping around, you see your master standing in the shadows, watching you. His expression is unreadable, but something in his voice is wrong. Off. You expected anger, maybe even disappointment, but instead… he sounds amused.</p>
  
    <p>“The key to immortality isn't anything too complicated,” he continues, stepping forward, the dim candlelight barely illuminating his face.</p>
  
    <p>“What…?” you manage, still catching your breath. He shouldn’t be here. He should be asleep.</p>
  
    <p>His eyes gleam. “Tell me, what is immortality?”</p>
  
    <p>You hesitate before answering, “It’s… having eternal life.”</p>
  
    <p>He shakes his head. “Nope.”</p>
  
    <p>Confused, you frown. “What do you mean?”</p>
  
    <p>His lips curl into a small smile. “Immortality isn’t about just living forever. It’s about being alive at all times. Infinite lifespans.” His gaze sharpens. “Tell me—how old do you think I am?”</p>
  
    <p>You shift uneasily. “I… I don’t know.”</p>
  
    <p>The corners of his mouth stretch into a grin. “I’m on my 613th life.”</p>
  
    <p>Your heart nearly stops.</p>
  
    <p>“You—” You swallow, your throat dry. “You’ve successfully performed the spell?”</p>
  
    <p>His eyes don’t leave yours. “That’s right.”</p>
  
    <p>Hope floods your chest. “Then what’s the secret? I must save my brother!”</p>
  
    <p>His smile widens. “It’s simple. All you need… is a life.”</p>
  
    <p>Something in his tone makes your stomach twist. The words echo in your mind, sinking in too slowly.</p>
  
    <p>Then you realize the truth. He’s been taking lives.</p>
  
    <p>“You… you’re a murderer,” you whisper, stepping back.</p>
  
    <p>His expression remains unchanged, his voice eerily smooth. “Is it really murder?” He tilts his head. “If I was dead, and now I’m alive?”</p>
  
    <p>Your pulse pounds in your ears. He takes a slow step forward. You take another step back. Then his hand lifts, and a violent surge of magic erupts toward you.</p>
    
    <p>The battle is quick and brutal. Your spells are raw, fueled by adrenaline, but his are precise, practiced. He isn’t just testing you—he’s trying to kill you. You barely dodge a bolt of crackling energy that shatters the shelves behind you. If you don’t end this soon, you won’t make it out alive.</p>
  
    <p>Desperate, you cast a blinding light. He recoils, shielding his eyes.</p>
  
    <p>It’s the opening you needed.</p>
  
    <p>You lunge forward, pressing your palm against his forehead. He gasps as you chant the incantation one last time, the words searing through the air.</p>
  
    <p>A sudden silence falls over the room. Then he collapses.</p>
  
    <p>For a long moment, you don’t move. Your hands are trembling. You place one over your chest. Your heart is still beating. Slowly, you flex your fingers. You should feel relieved. Triumphant. Instead, a cold realization washes over you.</p>
  
    <p>You have become immortal.</p>
  
    <p>But you one glance at the clock tells you that you've failed your true goal. Your brother is already gone.</p>
