  <h1>Watching in Silence</h1>

  <p>You stay frozen as the Princess charges forward, only realizing your grave mistake when the dragon quickly steps backward and raises its throat. You know from your recent observations that this means it is about to unleash its deadly fire.</p>

  <p>“Princess! Dodge!” you shout.</p>

  <p>But you are too late.</p>

  <p>The Princess is engulfed in flames, and as she staggers backward, you think she is gone forever.</p>

  <p>Tears form in your eyes, but once again, she surprises you. With an agonized scream, she lifts her head, and the dragon hesitates—just for a moment. That hesitation costs the beast dearly, as the Princess takes the opportunity to lunge forward and stab her silver sword deep into its leg.</p>

  <p>The dragon hisses and screeches in pain. Then, it turns its gaze toward you.</p>

  <p>You swear, for the briefest moment, it looks almost regretful as dark gas begins to seep from its mouth.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, dizziness washes over you. Your knees buckle, and the small stones beneath you do nothing to cushion your fall as you collapse into darkness.</p>

  <p>***</p>

  <p>You wake up feeling nauseous, pale light streaming through the cave entrance. Judging by the brightness, you’ve been unconscious all night.</p>

  <p>With a sudden jolt, you sit up and your breath catches in your throat—</p>

  <p>The Princess lies face down on the cave floor.</p>

  <p>Dread floods your veins as you stumble toward her motionless form. You press your fingers against her neck, searching desperately for any sign of life.</p>

  <p>There is none.</p>

  <p>The dragon is nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>Panic overtakes you. You sprint out of the cave, feet pounding against the earth as you run without direction, without thought. You cannot return home—once the truth is discovered, you will surely be executed for the Princess’s death.</p>

  <p>But your escape is short-lived.</p>

  <p>A deep, guttural growl echoes through the trees.</p>

  <p>You slow to a stop, panting, as shadowy figures emerge from the darkness. The beasts of the Dark Forests have found you.</p>

  <p>And they will be the ones to punish you for your mistakes.</p>

  <h2 class="bad-ending">BAD ENDING: YOU HAVE LOST BOTH THE DRAGON AND THE PRINCESS, AND HAVE DIED</h2>
